| Definition                | SQL databases are primarily called  RDBMS or Relational Databases                                                                  | NoSQL databases are primarily called as  Non-relational or distributed database                                                                                                             |
| Design for                | Traditional RDBMS uses SQL syntax  and queries to analyze and get the  data for further insights. They  are used for OLAP systems. | NoSQL database system consists of various kind of database technologies. These databases were developed in response to the demands presented for the development of the modern application. |
| Query Language            | Structured query language (SQL)                                                                                                    | No declarative query language                                                                                                                                                               |
| Type                      | SQL databases are table based databases                                                                                            | NoSQL databases can be document based, key-value pairs, graph databases                                                                                                                     |
| Schema                    | SQL databases have a predefined schema                                                                                             | NoSQL databases use dynamic schema for unstructured data.                                                                                                                                   |
| Ability to scale          | SQL databases are vertically scalable                                                                                              | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable                                                                                                                                                   |
| Examples                  | Oracle, Postgres, MySQL and MS-SQL.                                                                                                | MongoDB, Redis, , Neo4j, Cassandra, Hbase.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Best suited for           | An ideal choice for the complex  query intensive environment.                                                                      | It is not good fit complex queries.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Hierarchical data storage | SQL databases are not suitable for  hierarchical data storage                                                                      | More suitable for the hierarchical  data store as it supports key-value  pair method.                                                                                                       |

## When use SQL?
* SQL is the easiest language used to communicate with the RDBMS
* Analyzing behavioral related and customized sessions
* Building custom dashboards
* It allows you to store and gets data from the database quickly
* Preferred when you want to use joins and execute complex queries
## When use NoSQL?
* When ACID support is not needed.
* When Traditional RDBMS model is not enough
* Data which need a flexible schema
* Constraints and validations logic not required to be implemented in database
* Logging data from distributed sources
* Should be used to store temporary data like shopping carts, wish list and session data
